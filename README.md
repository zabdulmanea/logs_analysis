# Log Analysis
An internal reporting tool uses information from the database of newspaper articles and web servers log. This reporting tool aims to build an informative summary of most articles people like to read, most authors people like thier article and the days when more than 1% request errors has occured. The project is guided by [Udacityâ€™s Full Stack Developer Nanodegree Program](https://sa.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004).

## Project Description
This is a python module uses information from logs in a large database and build an informative summary from that information. The database of this project is from a newspaper database and it includes three tables:
* `Authors`: includes information about articles authors.
* `Articles`: includes information of articles.
* `Log`: includes logs of every article request to the web server.

#### The project aims to solve these question:
1. What are the most popular three articles of all time?
2. Who are the most popular article authors of all time?
3. On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?

## Creating Views
1. Open terminal and start the VM.

2. Run `psql -d news` - to connect to the database.

3. Create **Popular Articles** View
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW popular_articles AS
    SELECT articles.title AS "Popular Articles", COUNT(*) AS Views
    FROM log JOIN articles
    ON articles.slug = SUBSTRING(log.path,10)
    GROUP BY articles.title
    ORDER BY Views DESC LIMIT 3;
```
|     Column      |  Type  | 
------------------|--------|
 Popular Articles | text   | 
 views            | bigint | 

4. Create **Popular Authors** View
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW popular_authors AS
    SELECT authors.name, COUNT(*) AS Views
    FROM log, articles, authors
    WHERE SUBSTRING(log.path,10) = articles.slug
        AND articles.author = authors.id
    GROUP BY authors.name
    ORDER BY views DESC;
```
| Column |  Type  |
---------|--------|
 name    | text   | 
 views   | bigint | 

5. Create **Request Errors** View
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW log_errors AS
    WITH logs_status AS(
        SELECT time::date AS date, status, COUNT(*) AS status_num
        FROM log
        GROUP BY date, status )
    SELECT to_char(a.date, 'FMMonth DD, YYYY') AS Date,
        Round((b.status_num*1.0/(a.status_num+b.status_num))*100, 2) AS error
    FROM logs_status a JOIN logs_status b
    ON a.date = b.date AND a.status < b.status
    WHERE (b.status_num*1.0/(a.status_num+b.status_num)*100) > 1;
```
| Column |  Type   |
---------|---------|
 date    | text    |
